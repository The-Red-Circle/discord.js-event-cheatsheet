# discord.js-event-cheatsheet
A quick and dirty fleshing out of the discord.js event listeners .

# Warning
Discord.Js version 11 has fallen behind the current API specs therefore is no longer a valid library version to use.
However somepeople still use it?!
Anyways Discord.js v11 will hard crash if you encounter a stage channel, so just switch to v12.

# Credit 
The original code for the `discord.js-v11-cheatsheet.js` wasn't from me.

Original file from https://gist.github.com/koad/316b265a91d933fd1b62dddfcc3ff584 made by [Koad](https://gist.github.com/koad)

The original code was made for discord.js v11. This code can be found in `discord.js-v11-cheatsheet.js`.


However v12 was released and some things have changed. These changes can be found in `discord.js-v12-cheatsheet.js`.
